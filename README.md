# TGAdvertiserBOT for Telegram
This is a telegram user-bot based off the [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram) library in Python3. 

# How it works

This user-bot will send predefined messages at chats every certain amount of time automatically, as long as the user is a participant of the chat and has permissions to send a message.

# Installation

You can run this bot on your own, install the required lib by running this command: 

```bash
pip install pyrogram
```


In the `config.json` file you will find api_id, api_hash, message_text and chats variables, get your [API credentials from Telegram's official website](https://my.telegram.org/auth):

Now you can simply run the bot by running `main.py`
